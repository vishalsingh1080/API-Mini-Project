# API-Mini-Project

A basic attempt at interacting with apis to extract information from websites and to get the data needed for a particular data science task at hand. For this mini project I scrape the Quandl website, Using python requests library and Quandl API. The received data is in JSON format and a set of tasks are performed with the scraped data.
